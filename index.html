		     I was excited to present some of my recent work during the Robust Optimization Webinar series. Full video of this talk can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QyNkE5K_Y0&t=556s&ab_channel=RobustOptimizationWebinar">here </a>. 
		     Many thanks to Jannis Kurtz and Ahmedreza Marandi for the organization and the invitation. 	
		 </li>  
		 <li>
		     I was happy to present a tutorial on "Decision rules for robust adjustable optimization" during the Optimization at the Second Level workshop at CIRM, Marseille. Many thanks to the organizing comitee for the invitation.	
		 </li>  
		 <li>
		     A revised version of our paper "Uncertainty reduction in robust optimization" is now <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04158877">available </a>. This is joint work with <a href="https://cv.hal.science/michael-poss"> Michael Poss</a>.		
		 </li>  
		<li>
		     Our paper "KidneyExchange.jl: A Julia package for solving the kidney exchange problem with branch-and-price" accepted for publication in Mathematical Programming Computation is now available online. 
		     This is joint work with <a href="https://researchgate.net/profile/Jeremy-Omer">Jérémy Omer </a> and Fulin Yan. Full text is available <a href="https://rdcu.be/dwnC9"> here</a>.
